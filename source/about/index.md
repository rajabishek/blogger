## Hi, I'm Raj Abishek 
I am an experimental programmer designing code since 2013 aspiring to make a name in the technology space by developing cutting edge products. I am currently pursuing Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering at [VIT University](http://www.vit.ac.in).

I interned at [Razorpay](http://razorpay.com) during the winter of 2015 and at [Skcript](http://skcript.com) in summer of 2015. 

I have also worked as an independent contractor for a few months with [Zorioo](http://zorioo.com) to build Paywall. A platform allowing publishers to monetize their website or app. I was responsible for development of core products such as Payments, Recursive Billing, Search , Photos, Profile, Web hooks and Applications and played an important role in designing and building core parts of the Paywall engineering infrastructure.

When not working, you can usually find me sketching designs, reorganizing my workspace or hanging out with my friends.

I maintain a post on my Setup at [/setup](/setup).

I push most of my code to [GitHub](http://github.com/rajabishek).

I have been a member of CodeYGEN (Software Development Section of VIT Chennai) since my first year in college.

I am an [HN](http://news.ycombinator.com) addict.

I can be stalked on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/TheRajAbishek) or [Instagram](http://instagram.com/TheRajAbishek).
