## Design, Startups & Things in Between
I am a designer with a degree in computers and deep love for digital products. Passionate about user centered design and obsessed with designing products that are usable, friendly & engaging. I was born & raised in a small paradise called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_Tamil_Nadu" target="_blank">Salem</a> in the Tamil Nadu, India.

Currently disrupting the future of sales with <a href="https://www.pipecandy.com" target="_blank">PipeCandy</a>. Previously worked at <a href="http://www.multunus.com" target="_blank">Multunus</a> helping them in the big mission of transform ideas into outstanding user-centric digital products. Previously interned at [Razorpay](http://razorpay.com) during the winter of 2015 and at [Skcript](http://skcript.com) in summer of 2015.

When not working, you can usually find me troubling others, reorganizing my workspace or hanging out with my friends.
