##Introduction
One of the advantages of using Adobe Illustrator over many other tools is that, it is one of the vector based programs that are available in the market. Adobe Photoshop for example is a raster based program. In a vector based program any shapes that we generate are based on mathematical equation between points and lines that draw out the correct shape, and thus we can scale up and down with loosing even a tiny bit of quality. Once we create lets say a logo as a vector we can use it in business cards or even as large as bill boards. Whereas in a raster based program like photoshop we can only scale down the image without loosing the quality, as the image is made up of group of pixels, where each pixel can take a color or a shade.
