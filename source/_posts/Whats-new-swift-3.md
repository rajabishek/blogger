## What's new & what's gone
To be honest Swift 3 has lot of changes. If you compile in Xcode 8, it will complain at your code. Apple integrated Swift 3 into Xcode 8 beta at WWDC 2016. Swift 3 is coming later this year. If you haven’t been following the Swift Evolution project closely, you may wonder what are the new changes and how it will affect your code, and when you should start porting your code to Swift 3. This article can help you with that.

## Getting hands on
So where do we run Swift 3 and experiment with it ? Swift 3 preview is available in Xcode 8 beta which developers can download and try now. As Swift 3 is not officially released by Apple yet, developers have to wait till the year's end before they can publish an app to the store that is written in Swift 3.

As of now along with Xcode 8 beta Apple has included Swift 2.3 & Swift 3. Swift 2.3 is the same as Swift 2.2 but with support for many of the new SDKs and Xcode features announced at WWDC 2016. Once Xcode 8 comes out of beta, you will be able to submit apps using Swift 2.3 if you have not yet migrated your code to Swift 3.

Its a good thing that Apple will include Swift 2.3 also in Xcode 8 stable release not creating problems for people who aren't learning Swift 3 yet. Apple has also included a Migration Assistant in Xcode to port the application to Swift 3. I highly recommend you to create a new branch in git and use that to get a feel of what has changed. But since you can’t release an app to the App Store until Xcode 8 is out of beta and Swift 3 is officially released, it is better to wait porting the codebase to Swift 3 until things calm down a bit.
