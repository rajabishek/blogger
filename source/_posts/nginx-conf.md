## TRY_FILES
A very common try_files line which can be applied on your condition is
```sh
location / {
	try_files	$uri	$uri/	/test/index.html;
}
```

You probably understand the first part, location	/ matches all locations, unless
it's matched by a more specific location, like location	/test for example. The second part ( the try_files ) means when you receive a URI that's matched by this block try $uri first, for example http://example.com/images/image.jpg nginx will try to check if there's a file inside /images called image.jpg if found it will serve it first.

Second condition is $uri/ which means if you didn't find the first condition $uri try the URI as a directory, for example http://example.com/images/ , ngixn will first check if a file called images exists then it wont find it, then goes to second check $uri/ and see if there's a directory called images exists then it will try serving it. If there is no images directory it will retort to the third fallback option.

If there exists a directory called images and there is a index directive defined the nginx will try to check if the index exists inside this folder. For example if index is defined as index	index.html	index.htm then first nginx will try to serve the index.html file inside the images folder. If not present then it will try to serve the index.htm file inside the images folder. If none of the files listed in index directive is found or if the index directive was not at all present, then nginx will try to do a directory listing for the images folder. Now by default auto index is turned off in nginx, meaning directory listen must not be allowed. Therefore if we donâ€™t set auto index as on explicitly using autoindex on you'll probably get a 403 forbidden error, because directory listing is forbidden by default. It is a good practise to leave auto index as off because it can expose contents present under the document root.

If there is no images directory then the third condition /test/index.html is considered a fall back option, (you need to use at least 2 options, one and a fall back), you can use as much as you can (never read of a constriction before), nginx will look for the file index.html inside the folder test and serve it if it exists. If the third condition fails too, then nginx will serve the 404 error page.
