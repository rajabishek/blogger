## The term 'manager' is a misnomer
Product manager is very less of a manager. As a PM you have no authority to tell somebody what to do or what to work on. The role is to empower and steer your team towards a positive outcome. A PM should ideally be someone the team trusts and wants to work with.

## Ask more questions
You can't decide without understanding something completely. So ask questions and get things clarified. As a product owner understanding why things are the way they are and by questioning the reasoning behind everything allows you to take informed decisions.

## PM = Proactive Manager
Being proactive is one of the key qualities in product management. As a PM, you act as a mediator between different teams, so the sooner you take initiative, the sooner others can get their work done.

Being a mediator means your work becomes less orthogonal with others and more people start depending on the work that you do. So complete things right away rather that putting it off for later.

## Managing Risk
One of the important tasks of a product manager is managing risk. What worse than a product that fails, is a product that you wish never shipped. Shipping is a one way street. Its is very hard to take back things once released. As you are exposed to hearing a lot of product feedback, new ideas and changes. You should take a call by analyzing the risk involved with a feature. 
You would have attended meetings where everyone agrees for an idea but when you ask why we have gathered here no one has a clear definition of what are the benefits for implementing this feature. Always have a couple of low risk items on hand and push the risky ones to later stage till you are done with a demand research and come back with clarity.

You are responsible for every feature you put in your product. You better have a reason for why it’s there in the first place. Don't just ship features because you have enough bandwidth in a sprint.

## Bringing clarity
One of the important reasons you are hired for is to bring clarity. It's your responsibility to guide your stakeholders and help them in figuring out what to build. Every stakeholder has their own perspective of what's valuable and everyone has different expectations of what they are going to get in the next release. Its your job to dissolve this ambiguity and keep everyone on the same boat.

## Love the problem, not the solution
Its easy to get attached to solutions and jump straight at building them. But solutions are cheap. So channelize all our initial energy towards finding out if its a worthy enough problem to solve, instead of acquiring more resources to build out the solution.

## Don't turn your product into a feature factory
Anyone who does product design has to switch between looking at the world from two different perspectives - **Demand**(what people want from the product) and **Supply**(features to be built).

Many times when we think we've identified demand, what we have really identified is just supply-side thinking. Next time when you sit for customer interviews or in a backlog grooming session listen closely for the problems and be skeptical about the solutions.

If you aren't investing in identifying what the true demand is, then it’s really not any different from having somebody who is higher up in the company walking in and saying, **I wan't you guys to build this, like this**.

## It’s really okay not to know
Designers and product managers are usually considered as the wise ones in the room who always have answers to customer problems at their fingertips. And when you say **I don't know** people look at you in a strange way. But product design is not about knowing the right answers. It’s about finding them.

So the next time you’re asked a question that cannot — or shouldn’t — be answered, just say: **I don’t know**. But make sure you go back and find the answer.

## Dealing with uncertainties
There can be situations when you have a lot of uncertainties associated with the project you are working on. Reduce your sprint cycle in these case.

## Don’t turn yourselves into a bottleneck
As a PM you might do a variety of tasks and do whatever is necessary to get the job done. But its easy to quickly turn yourselves into a bottleneck. Especially when you are low on resources, you might end up in situations where the team just drops in their not-so-fun tasks on you. A good example is Quality Assurance.

If you’re a fresh and enthusiastic PM, you’re likely to pick up this type of tasks and do them all by yourself. It sends a good message to the team, right? They can rely on you, you’re doing tedious work!. **Wrong**. While doing things that nobody else wants to do is part of our job, if you don’t share non-core tasks across the whole team, you‘ll become a bottleneck. And what’s even worse is that this reduces the time spent on your core tasks.

A good team distributes responsibility across all members, it’s everyone’s duty to pick up tasks that would otherwise fall off the table.

## Data driven decision making
Trust your gut, but trust data more. Keep improving your tools and setup. Try to make to make hypotheses, validate them, think of several effects, causation vs. correlation. Keep measuring value and find out how helpful your product is.

- Collecting data is still experimental in most companies. There’s usually no clear strategy and the tagging plan is always work in progress. To everyone’s defense, it’s hard to decide what to measure and how. Even the fancy tools like Google Analytics 360, Heap or Hotjar are new. They change features and look different every other day.
- Converting data into insights is at least as hard as collecting. There are so many things going on that could affect your data!. Seasonality, marketing campaigns, feature releases, bugs, the data gets easily skewed and understanding what happened becomes very hard.

Making decisions on incorrect data and false assumptions is worse than deciding on a healthy gut feeling.

## Early and regular feedback
You should have regular O3 meetings not just with your line manager but with everyone you work with. By having one-to-ones, you can receive & give feedback to catch possible issues early and get insights into each individual’s life.

The goal is to listen more and talk less. Use these meetings as a private retrospective where you decide together how to your improve day to day work. One of the strategies to keep the discussions in these meeting going well is what I call the RIC(Remove, Improve, Create) framework.

## Be a design thinking evangelist
Stick with your design process it will take you a long way, don’t skip it. Design thinking framework combines the problem-solving roots of design with deep empathy for the user. More than just empathy the framework encourages you to move through product iterations at a design level, saving engineering time. In this way you get to learn, solve disagreements and test hypotheses quickly even before you launch.

It can be hard to employ the tradition waterfall approach to design in agile sprints. One good solution I've found is to use the time boxed activities from [design sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/). You can read more about this [here](https://rajabishek.com/2017/Lean-early-learn-often/).
 
## Be a hustler
The act of earning something from seemingly nothing is the art of hustling. You may not always have everything you need. Especially in early stage startup where resources are low, this is a common problem. With the limited availability you should find innovative ways to solve a problem.

When you have a blocker, don’t throw your hands up in the air and call it done—find a workaround. Find a way to reduce the scope. Work with the energy and optimism that it can be done, and that you’ll find a way.
