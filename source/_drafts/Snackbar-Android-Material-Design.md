## Better notifications
Material design includes another interesting component called as a snackbar. They are just like toast messages except they also provide action to interact with. And unlike toast notification which can exist independently of the application(even after the application was closed), snackbar messages feel more tied up with the application's user interface, as they are presented as a small bar sliding from the bottom of the screen. We can even swipe them off to dismiss them.
