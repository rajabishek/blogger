## Introduction
Vim is an extension of the Vi editor. Vi has been in existence since a very long time. Vim however is much more recent. It was created by ** Bram Moolenaar**.

I use vim for almost everything today programming, writing articles, writing notes etc. In fact this blog article was itself written using the vim editor. I must state here very early that vim does have a huge learning curve, but with a little bit of patience and practice you will be able to master this wonderful tool.

If you don't like vim, its perfectly fine, after all we use all these tools just to feel more comfortable and be more productive. If you feel vim is disturbing your workflow and it doesn't suit your need, its absolutely ok.
