## Introduction
Vim is an extension of the Vi editor which has been existing since a very long time. Vim however is much more recent. It was created by Bram Moolenaar. I personally use vim every single day, for very sort of task, writing note, programming etc. Infact this blog article was itself written in the vim editor. I must state here very early that many people hate vim because of it's high learning curve. However with a little bit of practice and patience you will be able to master this wonderful tool. If you don't like vim, its perfectly fine, after all we use all these tools just to feel more comfortable and be more productive. If you feel vim is disturbing your workflow and it doesn't suit your need, its absolutely ok.
