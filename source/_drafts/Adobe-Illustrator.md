##Introduction
One of the advantages of using Adobe Illustrator over many other tools is that, it is one of the vector based programs that are available in the market. Adobe Photoshop for example is a raster based program. In a vector based program any shapes that we generate are based on mathematical equation between points and lines that draw out the correct shape, and thus we can scale up and down with loosing even a tiny bit of quality. Once we create lets say a logo as a vector we can use it in business cards or even as large as bill boards. Whereas in a raster based program like photoshop we can only scale down the image without loosing the quality, as the image is made up of group of pixels, where each pixel can take a color or a shade. 

Raster based programs are good for image editing and photography, but when is comes to designing scalable graphics, vectors are the way to go. Raster images are usually stored as jpg, bmp, png tiff & gif (bitmap files types). Raster images are also called as bitmap images. Vector images are stored as pdf, eps, svg, ai, swf files(vector file types). 

One thing that you should not is that when a vector image is saves in a bitmap file type format it gets rasterized, in the sense the shape is converted to be made up of group of pixels. Wheres a vector file type can contain both bitmap images and raster images, therefore when a bitmap image is saved in a vector file type format the image is still only in the raster form, it doesn't get converted into a vector. The basic reason behind this being that converting a raster image to vector is not that simple and it ofter requires special tools with manual tinkering in certain places.

The idea to take way from this note is that Adobe Illustrator is a vector based program that allows users to create vector graphics that can scale up or down without loosing any quality and thus is suitable for most of the design work.
