## Usefulness + Simplicity
I was particular in not reinventing the wheel. I wanted to use interface elements that all mobile users are already used to. Because if you think about it, users must be able to recognize what itâ€™s for and how to use it.

Usefulness and simplicity is the key. If the application is not useful, there is no reason why the user will want to use it, and at the same time no one would bother spending time learning how to use your app. The app has to be simple and self explanatory.

## On-boarding Screens
The onboarding process is a critical step in setting your users up for success with your product, but there are a number of considerations and hard decisions to be made when you are designing your onboarding to define how best to get your users familiar with your product and its value.

**Avoid long tutorials**
Its not a really good idea to put the user through swiping several screens in the name of getting them started. Its a good practice to keep the number of screens fewer than five.

**On-boarding must be contextual and progressive**
Rather than presenting all the features up-front, its better to provide guidance as they use.
