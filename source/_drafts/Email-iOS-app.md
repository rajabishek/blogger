## Good design = usefulness + simplicity
The most important thing that I had in mind while building the project was never to compromise on the design. I was also particular about not reinventing the wheel, I wanted to use interface elements that all mobile users are already used to (concepts from Apple Human Interface guidelines & Android material design). To be effective using an interface you’ve designed, people must be able to recognize what it’s for and how to use it.

It all boils down to usefulness and simplicity. If the application is not useful, there is no reason why the user will want to download it and use it, and at the same time no one would bother spending time learning how to use your app. No one has got time for that today. The app has to be simple and self explanatory.
