## More than just a deliverable
While a persona is usually presented as single-page document, it is more than just a deliverable. It is a way to summarize and communicate the research details to other team members who were absent during the user research. The process of transferring knowledge about the users is more important than the document itself. This articles focuses more about what personas are and why they are beneficial. To read about how effectively you can create personas please refer to this [article](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/contacts-user-guide-v2/how-to-create-personas).

## Why should you use personas ?
Personas have been used by designers since the mid 90s and has become a very popular technique since then. As a UX Designer, personas are one of the best methods that I have found which can improve the consistency and quality of the work that we do. When I started using personas it seemed as a distraction 
from the real work until I actually witnessed them being used properly and to their full potential.
The document that captures the essential elements of a persona and a persona are not the same things. Many 

I emphasize this distinction because many people think of a persona and the document that captures essential elements of the persona as the same thing â€” they are not. It is all too easy for novice practitioners of goal-directed design to fixate on the **best way** to make a persona document and to lose sight of the bigger picture, which is to fully understand a user and then simply share the top-level information with others. For designers looking for a jump start on creating persona documents, I highly recommend the persona poster template by Creative Companion. This poster organizes and formats all of the important information that a designer would need to create an amazing one-page deliverable.

## Either 0% or 100%
For every one designer I have met who has benefited from persona driven design, I have met another who is completely against using this technique. Its either 0% or 100%. Either I see people using this very effectively or seeing this is as a waste of time. I wanted to probe more into why it works well for some set of designers and tried to understand how efficiently they exploit this methodology.

With some research it because very clear that design who benefited from personas:
- Knew when to use them and more importantly when not to use them.
- Did not see them as just a single page deliverable, rather they saw it as a communication tool.
- They weren't just using it in inception, personas were living till the end of the project and were used in all discussions and meetings.

Like every other design technique I wanted to experiment with personas and see how well it works for me. I was against the belief that personas are totally invaluable and felt that if we know when and how to use them effectively, it can be a useful technique to build a more consistent and user focused design.
