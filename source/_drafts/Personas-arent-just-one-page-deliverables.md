## Introduction
While a persona is usually presented as single-page document, it is more than just a deliverable. It is a way to summarize and communicate the research details to other team members who were absent during the research process. the process of transferring knowledge about the users is more important than the document itself. This articles focuses more about what personas are and why they are beneficial. To read about how effectively you can create personas please refer to this [article](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/contacts-user-guide-v2/how-to-create-personas).

Personas have been used by designers since the mid 90s and has become a very popular technique since then. As a UX Designer, personas are one of the best methods that I have found which can consistency and quality of the work that we do. I once also viewed them as a distraction from the real work at the hand until I witnessed them being used properly and to their full potential.

I emphasize this distinction because many people think of a persona and the document that captures essential elements of the persona as the same thing â€” they are not. It is all too easy for novice practitioners of goal-directed design to fixate on the **best way** to make a persona document and to lose sight of the bigger picture, which is to fully understand a user and then simply share the top-level information with others.
For designers looking for a jump start on creating persona documents, I highly recommend the persona poster template by Creative Companion. This poster organizes and formats all of the important information that a designer would need to create an amazing one-page deliverable.

For every one designer I have met who has benefited from persona driven design, I have met another designer who is against the technique of using personas in the design process. Like every other design technique I wanted to experiment with personas and see what works best for me. I was against the belief that personas are totally invaluable and felt that if we know when and how to use them effectively, we can exploit this strategy to build a more consistent and user centered design. Personas have been used by designers since the mid 90s and has been a very popular technique ever since then.
