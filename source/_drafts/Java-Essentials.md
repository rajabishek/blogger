## Introduction
Java is a general-purpose high-level computer programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995 that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 

It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
