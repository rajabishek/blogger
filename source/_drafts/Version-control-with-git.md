## Why do I need version control?
Version control is a system which records and stores every change made to a set of files, so that you can go back to a previous state at any time. Developers have been using this method for a long time (the first kind of version control system was developed in the 70s) and it is now unthinkable to seriously write software without one.

## Installation
Before installing git you might want to check whether git is already installed. You can open the terminal and type `git --version` to check the exact version that you have or you could do `which git` to find the location of git. If you don't have git installed, then you can head over to the downloads section of the official git [website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the git installer based on your operating system to install git on your computer.
