## Gradle basics
Gradle is an open source project available at http://gradle.org that is supported by a company called Gradle.Inc. Now for our android applications we needn't install Gradle. Gradle will come with Android Studio. Nevertheless you can also install it separately on your hard drive and use it separately. If you are not using Android Studio for android app development, then this is what you will need to do, you will have to install Gradle separately. Installing Gradle is really simple, you must have Java installed on your machine preferably the latest JDK. You need not install Groovy on you machine Gradle installed comes with groovy bundled inside. Gradle ships with its own Groovy library, therefore Groovy doesn't need to be installed separately.
