## Introduction
Gradle is used to build android applications. There is a plugin for gradle that allows us to configure android applications. There are various build types available, we could build a release build or a debug build. We could setup an automatic signing configuration, so that we can digitally sign the output apks in preparation for uploading them to the google play store. e can also define additional build types if we want. We will also look at the concept of flavors.

A flavor allows you to essentially build the same app in multiple different ways with slight changes to the look and feel or even changes to the application itself. A combination of a flavour and a build type is known as a variant. We will also look at using our own android library projects as part of a larger android application, so that we can split functionality into reusable components that can be part of other applications as well.
