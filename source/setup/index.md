**Laptop Setup**:

1. MacBook Pro Retina 13-inch, Early 2015, 128GB SSD, 8GB RAM.
1. [Dell U2715H](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&cs=19&l=en&sku=210-ADKB) monitor
1. [Apple Magic Trackpad](http://www.apple.com/in/magic-accessories/)
1. [Apple External Keyboard](http://www.apple.com/shop/mac/mac-accessories/mice-keyboards). The chicklet keys are just amazing.
1. Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk.

**E-Reader**: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 2015 edition

**Mobile**:

1. [One Plus X](https://oneplus.net/x). Its one of the most elegant devices that I own. The detail given to the craftsmanship and artisan luxury is just amazing.

**Audio**:

1. [Apple Ear pods](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD827LL/A/apple-earpods-with-remote-and-mic) with Remote and Mic. Unlike traditional, circular earbuds, the design of the Apple EarPods is defined by the geometry of the ear.

For listening to music I use iTunes on desktop and Google Music on mobile/tablet.

**OS**: OSX El Captain

**Development**: I use iTerm2 for command line. I spend most of my time on either terminal or browser. Some of the terminal tools that I use daily:

- Vim for all my coding
- Git for version controlling. I put nearly everything in a git repo
- [SCM Breeze](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze) for easy git
- Whole lot of custom scripts
- My dotfiles are on [GitHub](http://github.com/rajabishek/dotfiles)

A5 ruled notebook and Stabilo fine tip pens for sketching when I am working on a user interface

**Browser**: Google Chrome with the following must have extensions:

- [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en) for API development and testing
- [Ghostery](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij) to block all the social nonsense
- [JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc) for pretty JSON
- [Motivation](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ofdgfpchbidcgncgfpdlpclnpaemakoj) for nothing is more motivating than to see your life pass by right in front of your eyes
- [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) for offline reading


**Web Apps**:

- Most of Google stuff
- Google Drive for document management. Special mention because it helped me move away from Windows environment. Linux still doesn't have a half decent document suite

**Desktop Apps**: The few desktop apps that I do use include:

- [Slack](https://slack.com/) for team chat

- VLC. Because if not this then what else
- Adobe Illustrator and Sketch for creating mockups
