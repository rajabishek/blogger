**Laptop Setup**:

1. MacBook Pro Retina 13-inch, Early 2015, 128GB SSD, 8GB RAM.
1. [Dell U2715H](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&cs=19&l=en&sku=210-ADKB) monitor
1. [Apple Magic Trackpad](http://www.apple.com/in/magic-accessories/)
1. [Apple External Keyboard](http://www.apple.com/shop/mac/mac-accessories/mice-keyboards). The chicklet keys are just amazing.
1. Seagate Backup Plus 1 TB External Hard Disk.

**E-Reader**: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 2015 edition

**Mobile**:

1. [One Plus X](https://oneplus.net/x). Its one of the most elegant devices that I own. The detail given to the craftsmanship and artisan luxury is just amazing.

**Audio**:

1. [Apple Ear pods](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD827LL/A/apple-earpods-with-remote-and-mic) with Remote and Mic. Unlike traditional, circular earbuds, the design of the Apple EarPods is defined by the geometry of the ear.

For listening to music I use iTunes on desktop and Google Music on mobile/tablet.
